# Recommendation System with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Regularizing Factor

This project implements a matrix factorization algorithm using **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. It predicts user ratings for movies and evaluates performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Influence by Netflix Recommendation System challenge

Did this over spring break, nothing too serious. Just a little practice with matrix algorithms. Got some random test, train dataset.
